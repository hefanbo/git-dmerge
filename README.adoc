# git-dmerge

## Overview
NOTE: Modified from https://github.com/thenigan/git-diffall[git-diffall]

This script performs a directory diff and merge between a commit in the repository and the working tree using the external diff or merge tool for git. It is intended for merging branches manually without trying to automatically merge files.

## Installation
Copy the script to the directory where your `git` is installed:

[source,bash]
----
cd <directory with git-dmerge>
cp git-dmerge $(git --exec-path)
----

Setup `diff.tool` for git. For example:

[source,bash]
----
git config --global diff.tool meld
----

For Window, path should be specified. For example:

[source,bash]
----
git config --global difftool.meld.path "C:\Program Files (x86)\Meld\Meld.exe"
----

## Usage
[source,bash]
----
git dmerge [-x|--extcmd=<command>] <commit>[..|...] [-- <path>*]

    -x=<command>
    --extcmd=<command>  Specify a custom command for viewing diffs.
                 git-dmerge ignores the configured defaults and
                 runs $command $LOCAL $REMOTE when this option is
                 specified.

If success, expected next steps are:
    Review results
    $ git merge -s ours --no-commit <commit>
    Stage and commit
----

## Example

Scenario: merge branch BBB to branch AAA

. Checkout branch AAA.
. Make sure that there are no staged or unstaged changes.
. Run `git dmerge BBB`
. Manually merge diffs in the diff tool.
. Run `git merge -s ours --no-commit BBB`
. Stage and commit.
